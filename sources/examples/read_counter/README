Character device with read counter.

Read counter implemented using KEDR COI library (interception of 'read'
operation for file, created for character device).

Character device is taken from KEDR project (examples/sample_target/)
and annotated with calls of functions from read_counter implementation
(read_counter_init(), read_counter_detstroy(), CDEV_ADD_ANNOTATION(),
CDEV_DEL_ANNOTATION).
