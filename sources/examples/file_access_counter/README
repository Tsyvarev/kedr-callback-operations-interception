File access counter.

Implemented as payload module 'file_system_counter_module.ko' for KEDR.

For filesystem registered by the target module count mounts and
openings of files belonging to that filesystem. Only regular files
are counted.

These counters may be read from payload module parameters
'mount_counter' and 'file_counter'.

If target module registers several filesystem, sums counters for them.
