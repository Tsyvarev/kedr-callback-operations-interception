On the top level, the library operates with <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#interceptor"><em class="firstterm">interceptors</em></a>. Interceptor is a special object, which contains all information about how to intercept callback operations of the objects of particular type.
</p><p>
One piece of information, which interceptor contains, is what callback operations should be intercepted and what functions should be called before and/or after them. This information is organized into another special objects - <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#payload"><em class="firstterm">payloads</em></a>, which should be registered using suitable interceptor for take an effect.
</p><p>
Another piece of information for interceptor - set of objects, operations on which should be intercepted. These objects are reffered to as <span class="emphasis"><em>watched</em></span>. For make object watched by the interceptor, one need to call <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.watch">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</a></code>. <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.forget">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</a></code> removes object from the set.
</p><p>
These two pieces of information cannot be changed in mix. There are two state of interceptor:
'initialized' and 'started'.
</p><p>
When created, interceptor is in the first state, which allows registration and deregistration of payloads. But set of watched objects at this state is empty and cannot be changed.
</p><p>
After call of <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.start">kedr_coi_interceptor_start</a></code> interceptor moves from the first state to the second. At this moment, on the contrary, set of registered payloads become fixed, but set of watched objects is allowed to change. For return to the first state, one should call <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.stop">kedr_coi_interceptor_stop</a></code>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="payload_description"></a>4.2. Payloads for callback operations interception</h3></div></div></div><p>
<a class="firstterm" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.struct_payload"><em class="firstterm">Payload object</em></a> contains <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#interception_handler"><em class="firstterm">interception handlers</em></a>. Every interception handler define what function should be called and for what callback operation. Functions for interception handlers accept all parameters of callback operation plus some additional information. These handlers are grouped in two arrays - one for <a class="link" href="glossary.html#pre_handler">pre handlers</a>, which functions will be called before corresponding callback operation call and another for <a class="link" href="glossary.html#post_handler">post handlers</a>, which functions will be called after the callback operation.
</p><p>
For tell interceptor to use all handlers from payload, this payload should be registered with function <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.payload_register">kedr_coi_payload_register</a></code>. After all work is done, payload should be unregistered with <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.payload_unregister">kedr_coi_payload_unregister</a></code>.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="payload_description.internal_and_external"></a>4.2.1. Internal and external interception of callback operations</h4></div></div></div><p>
Pointer to callback operation of the object may be <code class="constant">NULL</code>, which has special meaning: instead of calling callback some other actions should be perfromed. These actions are the same for all objects and are known to all, so usually no interception is needed in that case.
</p><p>
By default, function from interception handler is called only when callback operation is set for watched object. Such interception is reffered to as <span class="emphasis"><em>internal</em></span>: pre- and post- handlers process parameters and result of the callback operation, which is an internal property of the object. ('internal' in that sence that this property is usually not observable by the object user.)
</p><p>
Sometimes one need to call a function whenever state of the object - external property - is changed, and this state changing is accompanied by calling some callback operation. The key feature of this case - the state will be changed even when corresponded callback operation is not set for the object.
</p><p>
Such state changing may be traced using <span class="emphasis"><em>external</em></span> interception of corresponded callback operation. Function from external interception handler will be called even when pointer to callback operation of the object is <code class="constant">NULL</code>. In that case a moment of the callback operation call is assumed to be a moment when pointer to callback operation is tested. Parameters of the interception function are those as would be if callback operation is set for the object.
</p><p>
For mark interception handler as external, its 'external' flag should be set. See <a class="xref" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.struct_pre_handler">Section 7.2.3, “struct kedr_coi_pre_handler”</a> for formal description of this flag.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="objects_watching"></a>4.3. Objects watching</h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="objects_watching.when_to_watch"></a>4.3.1. When call of <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> should be made</h4></div></div></div><p>
For do not miss object's operations call, <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.watch">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</a></code> should be called before any callback operation may be called on the object. There are several cases, when object's operations become callable externally.
</p><p>
In one case, object becomes known externally after the call of some 'register' function. E.g., <code class="function">register_filesystem</code> make <span class="type">file_system_type</span> object be known by VFS.
</p><p>
For notify KEDR COI that you want to intercept operations on that object, you may call <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> before or just after <code class="function">register_filesystem</code>.
</p><p>
In the other case, creation of the object with callback operations is responsibility of some callback operation, which is belong to another object. When kernel need the object, it simply call this callback operation and use object which it return. E.g., inode objects are created with <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> callback operation of the <span class="type">super block</span> object.
</p><p>
For notify KER COI that you want to intercept operations on that object, you may call <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> just after callback operation which creates this object. This call may be done inside post-handler for that operation, using KEDR COI library for its interception.
</p><p>
That case shows 'cascade' interception of callback operations: for intercept callback operation of the one object, you should intercept callback operation of the another object, which create this. Another object may be also created by callback operation belonged to the third object, and so on. Chain of such callback operation calls may have unlimited length, but number of handlers needed for intercept these operations is always limited with several operations.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="objects_watching.foreign_interceptor"></a>4.3.2. Objects with copied operations</h4></div></div></div><p>
There is one another case of declaration about object with callback operations: object is created internally by the kernel, its callback operations are copied from another object, then one of these operation is called for complete object's initialization. This way is used, e.g., for file objects, which operations may be copied from wide range of another objects: inodes, character devices('struct cdev') and others.
</p><p>
Interception of the callback operations only with interceptor described previously is impossible: object become known only inside its callback operation, but this callback operation cannot be intercepted because <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> shouldn't be called before object is known.
</p><p>
KEDR COI library contains special interceptor for this case - <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#foreign_interceptor"><em class="firstterm">foreign interceptor</em></a>. This interceptor is intended to watch for an 'prototype object' - object containing operations for another objects which will be created. For <span class="type">file</span> object, for example, prototype objects may be inodes or character devices. Unlike normal interceptor, foreign interceptor doesn't allow to set handlers for call before/after callback operations. Instead, it make all objects, created from this prototype object, be automatically watched by another interceptor.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="objects_watching.when_to_forget"></a>4.3.3. When <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> should be called</h4></div></div></div><p>
It is not a fatal error to not call <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.forget">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</a></code> for an objects, which is no longer interested for callback operations interception. All objects will be automatically forgotten at <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.stop">kedr_coi_interceptor_stop</a></code> call.
</p><p>
But nevertheless it is usefull to notify KEDR COI library about objects which became non-interesting for interception. One reason of this - every watched object requires resources used for its tracking. Though per-object resource consumption usually very low(about 10 bytes), thousands and even millions of objects may be created during system lifetime. So total wasted memory may rich considerable size. Another reason for call 'kedr_coi_interceptor_forget' when watched object is destroyed - if another object will be allocated at the same address as deleted one, it will be treated as already watched. This fact may lead to call interception handlers when it is not needed, or even cause <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor.watch">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</a></code> to return an error (it is a protection against more serious faults resulted from interception mechanism corruption).
</p><p>
By analogy with <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code>, <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> should be called when it is known that no callback operations may be called for that object. It prevents from missing callback operations calls in interception.
</p><p>
In one case, object's callback operations become externally anavailable after object's deregistration. E.g., <code class="function">unregister_filesystem</code> make <span class="type">file_system_type</span> object unavailable by VFS.
</p><p>
In this case <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> may be called after/before such deregistration function.
</p><p>
In another case, an object is destroyed by callback operation of the another object, or of the object itself. For example, inode object is destroyed by <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> operations of the super block.
</p><p>
In that case <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> may be called in interception handler for that callback operation.
</p><p>
Objects which created using foreign interceptor are usually destroyed after some callback operations. E.g. file object is destroyed just after its 'release' callback operation. <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> may be called in post-handler for that operation.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation"></a>4.4. Creation of the interceptors</h3></div></div></div><p>
Interceptors for different object types has a deal in common. All common things are combined into '<span class="type">struct kedr_coi_interceptor</span>', which is something like a virtual object. Concrete instances of this object are created using <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor_creation.indirect">kedr_coi_interceptor_create</a></code> or <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor_creation.direct">kedr_coi_interceptor_create_direct</a></code>. Two type of information should be passed to any of these functions for create interceptor: object's geometry and array of <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#intermediate_operation"><em class="firstterm">intermediate operations</em></a>.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.object_geometry"></a>4.4.1. Object's geometry</h4></div></div></div><p>
There are two types of the interceptors, which differs in the implementation of callback operations in the object. This difference in callback operations implementation affects on what function should be used for create interceptor.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.object_geometry.direct"></a>4.4.1.1. Direct interceptor</h5></div></div></div><p>
One type of the interceptor is a 'direct'. It is suitable for objects which contain pointers to callback operations as fields. One field correspond to one callback operation.
</p><p>
Interceptor for objects of that type is created using <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor_creation.direct">kedr_coi_interceptor_create_direct</a></code>, and size of objects structure is used as object's geometry information. Each callback operation for that objects is identified with offset of pointer to that operation inside object structure.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.object_geometry.indirect"></a>4.4.1.2. Indirect interceptor</h5></div></div></div><p>
Another type of interceptor is an 'indirect'. It is suitable for objects which operations are organized into one structure, distinct from the objects type. Objects itself contain one field which points to concrete structure of operations.
</p><p>
Interceptor for objects of that type is created using <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor_creation.indirect">kedr_coi_interceptor_create</a></code>, object's geometry information contain size of operations structure and offset of the field pointed to the operations inside objects structure. Each callback operation for that objects is identified with offset of pointer to that operation inside operations structure.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations"></a>4.4.2. Intermediate operations</h4></div></div></div><p>
KEDR COI interception mechanism  is based on replacing object's callback operations with another operations, referred to as <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#intermediate_operation"><em class="firstterm">intermediate</em></a>. These intermediate operations are responsible for call registered pre-handlers, post-handlers and object's original operation in correct order. There are several reasons, why these operations cannot be automatically generated by the library itself(see <a class="xref" href="using_kedr_coi.html#interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations.why_not_generated">Section 4.4.2.3, “Reasons why intermediate operations are not generated automatically by the library”</a>), so them should be written by hand.
</p><p>
Only those callback operations may be intercepted for which intermediate operations exist. Attempt to register payload which require to intercept other operation will result in error.
</p><p>
Really, intermediate operations should implement simple logic. Moreover, code of the intermediate operations may be generated from a few data about them(see <a class="xref" href="create_interceptors_using_kedr_gen.html">Section 6, “Create interceptors using template-based file generation”</a>). Intermediate operation should have same signature as original callback operation and should implement following logic:
</p><div class="procedure"><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step"><p>
Locally allocate(e.g., on the stack) object of type '<span class="type"><a class="type" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.struct_intermediate_info">struct kedr_coi_intermediate_info</a></span>'.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
Call <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor_creation.get_intermediate_info">kedr_coi_get_intermediate_info</a></code>, passing to it interceptor, owner object of this operation, offset of the corresponded callback operation(see <a class="xref" href="using_kedr_coi.html#interceptor_creation.object_geometry">Section 4.4.1, “Object's geometry”</a>) and info object allocated on the previous step. This call fills the info object.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
If array of pre-handlers(contained in the filled info object) is not empty, all pre-handlers from it should be called in order. All arguments of the intermediate operation should be passed to each handler as first arguments. Pointer to locally allocated and filled object of type '<span class="type"><a class="type" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.struct_operation_call_info">struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info</a></span>' should be passed as the last argument.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
Original operation(pointer to which is contained in the filled info object) should be called with arguments of intermediate operation. If pointer to original operation is NULL, code of the <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#default_callback_operation"><em class="firstterm">default operation</em></a> should be executed instead. Note that if intermediate operation is 'internal_only' (see <a class="xref" href="using_kedr_coi.html#interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations.internal_only">Section 4.4.2.1, “Intermediate operations only for internal interception”</a>), pointer to original operation will never be NULL.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
If array of post-handlers(contained in the filled info object) is not empty, all post-handlers from it should be called in order. All arguments of the intermediate operation should be passed to each handler as first arguments. If call of original operation has returned any value, this value should be passed to each handler after all intermediate operations arguments. Pointer to locally allocated and filled object of type '<span class="type"><a class="type" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.struct_operation_call_info">struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info</a></span>' should be passed as the last argument.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
If original operation return any value, this value should be returned by the intermediate operation.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Let object 'foo' be declared in that way:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
struct foo_operations;
struct foo
{
    int some_field;
    const struct foo_operations* foo_ops;
    void* some_other_fields;
};
struct foo_operations
{
    int (*do_smth)(struct foo* obj, long some_arg);
    void (*do_another)(struct foo* obj, int a, void* b);
};
</pre><p>
There is an example of intermediate operation for callback operation 'do_smth' of the object:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
struct kedr_coi_interceptor* interceptor;
//...
int intermediate_do_smth(struct foo* obj, long some_arg)
{
    struct kedr_coi_intermediate_info info;
    struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info call_info;
    int (*op_orig)(struct foo* obj, long some_arg);
    int result;
    
    kedr_coi_get_intermediate_info(interceptor,
        obj,
        offsetof(do_smth, struct foo_operations),
        &amp;info);
    
    call_info.return_address = __builting_return_address(0);
    call_info.op_orig = info.op_orig;
    
    if(info.pre)
    {
        void (**pre)(struct foo*, long, struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info*);
        for(pre = (typeof(pre))info.pre; *pre != NULL; pre++)
            (*pre)(obj, some_arg, &amp;call_info);
    }
    
    op_orig = (typeof(op_orig))info.op_orig;
    result = op_orig ? op_orig(obj, some_arg) : 0;
    
    if(info.post)
    {
        void (**post)(struct foo*, long, int, struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info*);
        for(post = (typeof(post))info.post; *post != NULL; post++)
            (*post)(object, some_arg, result, &amp;call_info);
    }
    
    return result;
}
</pre><p>
Note that here we process case when original callback operation of the object is NULL. We assume that this case has same effect as callback operation simply returning 0.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations.internal_only"></a>4.4.2.1. Intermediate operations only for internal interception</h5></div></div></div><p>
By default, callback operation may be intercepted even when pointer to it is NULL. This is achieved by setting 'external' flag of interception handler to true. In that case NULL pointer is replaced with pointer to intermediate operation, which should execute code of some <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#default_callback_operation"><em class="firstterm">default callback operation</em></a>.
</p><p>
But for some callback operations their default variant may be difficult to be implemented in the module. E.g. default <code class="function">d_dname</code> callback for <span class="type">dentry</span> object should use different locks which are accessible only for kernel core.
</p><p>
Other callback operations has no default variant at all - non-NULL callback operation endows object with properties differs from ones in case of NULL-pointer. E.g. non-NULL pointer to <code class="function">truncate_range</code> callback operation of inode object tells that this inode supports range truncation. And any non-NULL implementation of that callback cannot emulate same behaviour for the kernel. Another example: non-NULL pointer to the callback operation <code class="function">d_revalidate</code> is indicated by <code class="constant">DCACHE_OP_REVALIDATE</code> flag of dentry object. Without setting this flag replacing NULL-pointer to the callback operation with intermediate one has no effect.
</p><p>
For any intermediate there is a way to tell that interception for given callback operation shouldn't be used if pointer to it is <code class="constant">NULL</code>. This is achieved by setting flag 'internal_only' of the intermediate to true (see <a class="xref" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.interceptor_creation.struct_intermediate">Section 7.3.3, “struct kedr_coi_intermediate”</a>). Note, that 'internal_only' flag also prevents any external interception handler to be registered for this callback operation (see <a class="xref" href="using_kedr_coi.html#payload_description.internal_and_external">Section 4.2.1, “Internal and external interception of callback operations”</a>).
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations.grouping"></a>4.4.2.2. Grouping of intermediate operations</h5></div></div></div><p>
In some cases there is a way to intercept NULL-pointer to callback operation even when its default implementation is not accessible for module. Consider <code class="function">alloc_inode</code>and <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> callback functions for super block. First function should allocate memory for inode object, second one should free this memory. In-kernel default implementation of these callbacks (see <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> and <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> global functions implementation) uses memory cache, which is inaccessible for modules.
</p><p>
However, internal cache usage is not strictly required from these functions. It is required only the consistency between them - <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> should be applicable to the pointer returned by <code class="function">alloc_inode</code>. So one may use, for example, common <code class="function">kmalloc</code> and <code class="function">kfree</code> functions for implementations of the default callback operations. Such implementations work fine until be messed with in-kernel ones - attempt to apply <code class="function">kmem_cache_free</code> with internal memory cache to the result of kmalloc will crach the kernel.
</p><p>
The problem is that every intermediate function is used only when interception of corresponded callback operation is requested by some payload. So, interceptor user may require interception of <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> but do not use interception of <code class="function">alloc_inode</code>. In that case NULL-pointer to <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> callback operation will be replaced with intermediate operation, but NULL-pointer to <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> will be remained unchanged.
</p><p>
There is a way to tell interceptor that intermediates for <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> and <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> should be used in pair - either both or none. It is achieved by assigning same non-zero identificator to 'group_id' fields of this intermediates.
This make intermediate <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> to be used even without interception needs. 

</p><pre class="programlisting">
//...
struct inode* intermediate_alloc_inode(struct super_block* sb)
{
    struct inode* result;
    //...
    if(op_orig)
    {
        inode = op_orig(sb);
    }
    else
    {
        inode = kmalloc(sizeof(*inode), GFP_KERNEL);
        if(inode) inode_init_once(inode);
    }
    //...
    
    return inode;
}

void intermediate_destroy_inode(struct inode* inode)
{
    //...
    op_orig ? op_orig(inode) : kfree(inode);

It would be better if intermediate operations are generated internally by the library. But there are two barries to make this effectively.
</p><p>
The first problem - different callback operations accept different number of arguments and that arguments has different types. Because these arguments should be passed to the interception handlers, which signature is differ from callback operation's one, intermediate operation should be aware of signature of original one.
</p><p>
The second problem - while in the common OOP implementations virtual method accept object, on which this method is affects, as first argument, implementation of callback operations in the Linux kernel doesn't follow this principle everywhere. Some callback operations accept affected object as non-first argument (<code class="function">open</code> operation of the file object), others should extract affected object not from an argument but from the field of some argument (<code class="function">kill_sb</code> operation of file_system_type object).
</p><p>
Both these problems make fully automated generation of intermediate operations impossible. Runtime generation of the code of such operations based on some parameters is possible, but may be implemented only in machine codes, which is difficult and badly affects on cross-platform portability.

Foreign interceptor is created with function <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.foreign_interceptor_creation.indirect">kedr_coi_foreign_interceptor_create</a></code>. Next information should be passed to this function for describe interceptor created: object's geometry, intermediate operations and normal interceptor, which will be binded with new one.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="foreign_interceptor_creation.binded_interceptor"></a>4.5.1. Binded interceptor</h4></div></div></div><p>
Foreign interceptor is intended to use only for automatically watch for an objects by another interceptor, referred to as 'binded'. This binded interceptor should be passed to <code class="function">kedr_coi_foreign_interceptor_create</code> as first parameter. Only indirect interceptor(see <a class="xref" href="using_kedr_coi.html#interceptor_creation.object_geometry.indirect">Section 4.4.1.2, “Indirect interceptor”</a>) may be used as binded, attempt to use direct interceptor for this purpose will lead to error.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="foreign_interceptor_creation.object_geometry"></a>4.5.2. Object's geometry</h4></div></div></div><p>
The only parameter described object's geometry is an offset of the pointer to operations structure inside the prototype object.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="foreign_interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations"></a>4.5.3. Intermediate operations</h4></div></div></div><p>
Like a normal interceptor, foreign one uses <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#intermediate_operation"><em class="firstterm">intermediate operations</em></a> for implement interception mechanism. And like for a normal interceptor, intermediate operations for foreign one should be implemented by hands.
</p><p>
For foreign interceptor, intermediate operations should be only defined for those operations in prototype which will be called just after object is created from this prototype. E.g., the first operation which is called for file object when it is created is <code class="function">open</code>. So only this operation requires intermediate one.
</p><p>
Intermediate operation for foreign interceptor should have same signature as operation it replace, and implements following simple logic:
</p><div class="procedure"><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step"><p>
Locally allocate(on stack) pointer to the original operation.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
Call <code class="function"><a class="function" href="api_reference.html#api_reference.foreign_interceptor_creation.bind">kedr_coi_bind_prototype_with_object</a></code> and pass to it foriegn interceptor, prototype object, newly created object, offset of the operation replaced by this intermediate one and reference to the allocated pointer to the original operation.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
Call original callback operation. If pointer to it is <code class="constant">NULL</code>, <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#default_callback_operation"><em class="firstterm">default callback operation</em></a> should be called instead.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
If original(or default) operation returns any value, return this value.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
For example, intermediate operation for foreign interceptor, used character device('struct cdev') as prototype object for create file object('<span class="type">struct file</span>') may be implemented as follow:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
struct kedr_coi_foreign_interceptor* foreign_interceptor;
//...
static int intermediate_open(struct inode* inode, struct file* filp)
{
    int (*op_chained)(struct inode * inode, struct file * filp);

    kedr_coi_bind_prototype_with_object(foreign_interceptor,
        inode-&gt;i_cdev,
        filp,
        offsetof(struct file_operations, open),
        (void**)&amp;op_chained);
    
    return op_chained? op_chained(inode, filp) : 0;
}
</pre><p>
Note, that like for a normal interceptor, intermediate operation for foreing interceptor should correctly process case when original callback operation is <code class="constant">NULL</code>. For <code class="function">open</code> operation <code class="constant">NULL</code> pointer equivalents to callback simply returning <code class="constant">0</code>.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Unlike to normal interceptor, intermediate operations for foreign interceptor are used for replace original callback operation of object in any case. So 'internal_only' flag and grouping has no sence for intermediate operations of foreign interceptor.
