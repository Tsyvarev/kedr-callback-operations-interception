On the top level, the library operates with <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#interceptor"><em class="firstterm">interceptors</em></a>. Interceptor is a special object, which contains all information about how to intercept callback operations of the objects of particular type.
</p><p>
One piece of information, which interceptor contains, is what callback operations should be intercepted and what functions should be called before and/or after them. This information is organized into another special objects - <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#payload"><em class="firstterm">payloads</em></a>, which should be registered using suitable interceptor for take an effect.
</p><p>
Another piece of information for interceptor - set of objects, operations on which should be intercepted. These objects are reffered as to watched. For make object watched by the interceptor, one need to call <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code>. <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> removes object from the set.
</p><p>
These two pieces of information cannot be changed in mix. There are two state of interceptor:
'initialized' and 'started'.
</p><p>
When created, interceptor is in the first state, which allows registration and deregistration of payloads. But set of watched objects at this state is empty and cannot be changed.
</p><p>
After call of <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_start</code> interceptor moves from the first state to the second. At this moment, on the contrary, set of registered payloads become fixed, but set of watched objects is allowed to change. For return to the first state, one should call <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_stop</code>.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="description.when_to_watch"></a>3.1.1. When call of <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> should be made</h4></div></div></div><p>
For do not miss object's operations call, <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> should be called before any callback operation may be called on the object. There are several cases, when object's operations become callable externally.
</p><p>
In one case, object becomes known externally after the call of some 'register' function. E.g., <code class="function">register_filesystem</code> make <span class="type">file_system_type</span> object be known by VFS.
</p><p>
For notify KEDR COI that you want to intercept operations on that object, you may call <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> before or just after <code class="function">register_filesystem</code>.
</p><p>
In the other case, creation of the object with callback operations is responsibility of some callback operation, which is belong to another object. When kernel need the object, it simply call this callback operation and use object which it return. E.g., inode objects are created with <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> callback operation of the <span class="type">super block</span> object.
</p><p>
For notify KER COI that you want to intercept operations on that object, you may call <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> just after callback operation which creates this object. This call may be done inside post-handler for that operation, using KEDR COI library for its interception.
</p><p>
That case shows 'cascade' interception of callback operations: for intercept callback operation of the one object, you should intercept callback operation of the another object, which create this. Another object may be also created by callback operation belonged to the third object, and so on. Chain of such callback operation calls may have unlimited length, but number of handlers needed for intercept these operations is always limited with several operations.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="description.foreign_interceptor"></a>3.1.2. Objects with copied operations</h4></div></div></div><p>
There is one another case of declaration about object with callback operations: object is created internally by the kernel, its callback operations are copied from another object, then one of these operation is called for complete object's initialization. This way is used, e.g., for file objects, which operations may be copied from wide range of another objects: inodes, character devices('struct cdev') and others.
</p><p>
Interception of the callback operations only with interceptor described previously is impossible: object become known only inside its callback operation, but this callback operation cannot be intercepted because <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> shouldn't be called before object is known.
</p><p>
KEDR COI library contains special interceptor for this case - <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#foreign_interceptor"><em class="firstterm">foreign interceptor</em></a>. This interceptor is intended to watch for an 'prototype object' - object containing operations for another objects which will be created. For <span class="type">file</span> object, for example, prototype objects may be inodes or character devices. Unlike normal interceptor, foreign interceptor doesn't allow to set handlers for call before/after callback operations. Instead, it make all objects, created from this prototype object, be automatically watched by another interceptor.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="description.when_to_forget"></a>3.1.3. When 'kedr_coi_interceptor_forget' should be called</h4></div></div></div><p>
It is not a fatal error to not call <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> for an objects, which is no longer interested for callback operations interception. All objects will be automatically forgotten at <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_stop</code> call.
</p><p>
But nevertheless it is usefull to notify KEDR COI library about objects which became non-interesting for interception. One reason of this - every watched object requires resources used for its tracking. Though per-object resource consumption usually very low(about 10 bytes), thousands and even millions of objects may be created during system lifetime. So total wasted memory may rich considerable size. Another reason for call 'kedr_coi_interceptor_forget' when watched object is destroyed - if another object will be allocated at the same address as deleted one, it will be treated as already watched. This fact may lead to call interception handlers when it is not needed, or even cause fail in <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_watch</code> call(it is a protection against more serious faults resulted from interception mechanism corruption).
</p><p>
By analogy with <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_start</code>, <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_stop</code> should be called when it is known that no callback operations may be called for that object. It prevents from missing callback operations calls in interception.
</p><p>
In one case, object's callback operations become externally anavailable after object's deregistration. E.g., <code class="function">unregister_filesystem</code> make <span class="type">file_system_type</span> object unavailable by VFS.
</p><p>
In this case <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> may be called after/before such deregistration function.
</p><p>
In another case, an object is destroyed by callback operation of the another object, or of the object itself. For example, inode object is destroyed by <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> operations of the super block.
</p><p>
In that case <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> may be called in interception handler for that callback operation.
</p><p>
Objects which created using foreign interceptor are usually destroyed after some callback operations. E.g. file object is destroyed just after its 'release' callback operation. <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_forget</code> may be called in post-handler for that operation.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation"></a>3.2. Creation of the interceptors</h3></div></div></div><p>
Interceptors for different object types has a deal in common. All common things are combined into '<span class="type">struct kedr_coi_interceptor</span>', which is something like a virtual object. Concrete instances of this object are created using <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_create</code> or <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_create_direct</code>. Two type of information should be passed to any of these functions for create interceptor: object's geometry and array of <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#intermediate_operation"><em class="firstterm">intermediate operations</em></a>.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.object_geometry"></a>3.2.1. Object's geometry</h4></div></div></div><p>
There are two types of the interceptors, which differs in the implementation of callback operations in the object. This difference in callback operations implementation affects on what function should be used for create interceptor.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.object_geometry.direct"></a>3.2.1.1. Direct interceptor</h5></div></div></div><p>
One type of the interceptor is a 'direct'. It is suitable for objects which contain pointers to callback operations as fields. One field correspond to one callback operation.
</p><p>
Interceptor for objects of that type is created using <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_create_direct</code>, and size of objects structure is used as object's geometry information. Each callback operation for that objects is identified with offset of pointer to that operation inside object structure.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.object_geometry.indirect"></a>3.2.1.2. Indirect interceptor</h5></div></div></div><p>
Another type of interceptor is an 'indirect'. It is suitable for objects which operations are organized into one structure, distinct from the objects type. Objects itself contain one field which points to concrete structure of operations.
</p><p>
Interceptor for objects of that type is created using <code class="function">kedr_coi_interceptor_create</code>, object's geometry information contain size of operations structure and offset of the field pointed to the operations inside objects structure. Each callback operation for that objects is identified with offset of pointer to that operation inside operations structure.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations"></a>3.2.2. Intermediate operations</h4></div></div></div><p>
KEDR COI interception mechanism  is based on replacing object's callback operations with another operations, referred to as <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#intermediate_operation"><em class="firstterm">intermediate</em></a>. These intermediate operations are responsible for call registered pre-handlers, post-handlers and object's original operation in correct order. There are several reasons, why these operations cannot be automatically generated by the library itself(see <a class="xref" href="using_kedr_coi.html#interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations.why_not_generated">Section 3.2.2.2, “Reasons why intermediate operations is not generated automatically by the library”</a>), so them should be written by hand.
</p><p>
Only those callback operations may be intercepted for which intermediate operation is exist. Attempt to register payload which require to intercept other operation will result in error.
</p><p>
Really, intermediate operations should implements simple logic. Moreover, code of the intermediate operations may be generated from a few data about them(see <a class="xref" href="create_interceptors_using_kedr_gen.html">Section 5, “Create interceptors using template-based file generation”</a>). Intermediate operation should have same signature as original callback operation and should implement following logic:
</p><div class="procedure"><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step"><p>
Locally allocate(e.g., on the stack) object of type '<span class="type">struct kedr_coi_intermediate_info</span>'.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
Call 'kedr_coi_get_intermediate_info', passing to it interceptor, owner object of this operation, offset of the corresponded callback operation(see <a class="xref" href="using_kedr_coi.html#interceptor_creation.object_geometry">Section 3.2.1, “Object's geometry”</a>) and info object allocated on the previous step. This call fills the info object.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
If array of pre-handlers(contained in the filled info object) is not empty, all pre-handlers from it should be called in order. All arguments of the intermediate operation should be passed to each handler as first arguments. Pointer to locally allocated and filled object of type '<span class="type">struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info</span>' should be passed as the last argument.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
Original operation(pointer to which is contained in the filled info object) should be called with arguments of intermediate operation. If pointer to original operation is NULL, code of the <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#default_callback_operation"><em class="firstterm">default operation</em></a> should be executed instead.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
If array of post-handlers(contained in the filled info object) is not empty, all post-handlers from it should be called in order. All arguments of the intermediate operation should be passed to each handler as first arguments. If call of original operation has returned any value, this value should be passed to each handler after all intermediate operations arguments. Pointer to locally allocated and filled object of type '<span class="type">struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info</span>' should be passed as the last argument.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
If original operation return any value, this value should be returned by the intermediate operation.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Let object 'foo' be declared in that way:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
struct foo_operations;
struct foo
{
    int some_field;
    const struct foo_operations* foo_ops;
    void* some_other_fields;
};
struct foo_operations
{
    int (*do_smth)(struct foo* obj, long some_arg);
    void (*do_another)(struct foo* obj, int a, void* b);
};
</pre><p>
There is an example of intermediate operation for callback operation 'do_smth' of the object:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
struct kedr_coi_interceptor* interceptor;
//...
int intermediate_do_smth(struct foo* obj, long some_arg)
{
    struct kedr_coi_intermediate_info info;
    struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info call_info;
    int (*op_orig)(struct foo* obj, long some_arg);
    int result;
    
    kedr_coi_get_intermediate_info(interceptor,
        obj,
        offsetof(do_smth, struct foo_operations),
        &amp;info);
    
    call_info.return_address = __builting_return_address(0);
    call_info.op_orig = info.op_orig;
    
    if(info.pre)
    {
        void (**pre)(struct foo*, long, struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info*);
        for(pre = (typeof(pre))info.pre; *pre != NULL; pre++)
            (*pre)(obj, some_arg, &amp;call_info);
    }
    
    op_orig = (typeof(op_orig))info.op_orig;
    result = op_orig ? op_orig(obj, some_arg) : 0;
    
    if(info.post)
    {
        void (**post)(struct foo*, long, int, struct kedr_coi_operation_call_info*);
        for(post = (typeof(post))info.post; *post != NULL; post++)
            (*post)(object, some_arg, result, &amp;call_info);
    }
    
    return result;
}
</pre><p>
Note that here we process case when original callback operation of the object is NULL. We assume that this case has same effect as callback operation simply returning 0.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations.grouping"></a>3.2.2.1. Grouping of intermediate operations</h5></div></div></div><p>
A callback operation may be intercepted only if there is an intermediate operation for it, and if callback operation is intercepted(some registered payload contains interception handler for it), corresponded intermediate operation will be called instead of original callback operation. But if a callback operation interception isn't need, intermediate operation for it isn't used.
</p><p>
Usually such approach is useful, but there is a case when intermediate operation needs to be used whenever its corresponded callback operation needs to be intercepted. This is a situation when default operation for some callback operation may not be implemented exactly for some reasons(e.g., some variable or function definition is not available for module which implements intermediate operation).
</p><p>
For example, default <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> callback operation of super block should allocate memory for inode from the internal memory cache which is not accessible from kernel modules. According to the specification of <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> callback operation, it may allocate inode in any memory space. One may use this specification and implement <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> intermediate operation, e.g., via kmalloc. But default implementation of another callback operation, <code class="function">destroy_inode</code>, free exactly internal memory cache, which will lead to fault if the inode is allocated in another memory space.
</p><p>
Decision of the problem with <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> default callback operation may be:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
Implement default operation of <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> in intermediate operation via kmalloc.
    </li><li class="listitem">
Implement default operation of <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> in intermediate operation via kfree.
    </li><li class="listitem">
Enforce intermediate operations for <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> and <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> to be used with each other.
    </li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>
Last point may be implemented setting 'group_id' fields of intermediate operation structures('<span class="type">struct kedr_coi_intermediate</span>') for <code class="function">alloc_inode</code> and <code class="function">destroy_inode</code> to the same non-zero interger.

</p><pre class="programlisting">
//...
struct inode* intermediate_alloc_inode(struct super_block* sb)
{
    struct inode* result;

It would be better if intermediate operations are generated internally by the library. But there are two barries to make this effectively.
</p><p>
The first problem - different callback operations accept different number of arguments and that arguments has different types. Because these arguments should be passed to the interception handlers, which signature is differ from callback operation's one, intermediate operation should be aware of signature of original one.
</p><p>
The second problem - while in the common OOP implementations virtual method accept object, on which this method is affects, as first argument, implementation of callback operations in the Linux kernel doesn't follow this principle everywhere. Some callback operations accept affected object as non-first argument (<code class="function">open</code> operation of the file object), others should extract affected object not from an argument but from the field of some argument (<code class="function">kill_sb</code> operation of file_system_type object).
</p><p>
Both these problems make fully automated generation of intermediate operations impossible. Runtime generation of the code of such operations based on some parameters is possible, but may be implemented only in machine codes, which is difficult and badly affects on cross-platform portability.
</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="foreign_interceptor_creation"></a>3.3. Creation of the foreign interceptors</h3></div></div></div><p>
Foreign interceptor is created with function <code class="function">kedr_coi_foreign_interceptor_create</code>. Next information should be passed to this function for describe interceptor created: object's geometry, intermediate operations and normal interceptor, which will be binded with new one.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="foreign_interceptor_creation.binded_interceptor"></a>3.3.1. Binded interceptor</h4></div></div></div><p>
Foreign interceptor is intended to use only for automatically watch for an objects by another interceptor, referred to as 'binded'. This binded interceptor should be passed to <code class="function">kedr_coi_foreign_interceptor_create</code> as first parameter. Only indirect interceptor(see <a class="xref" href="using_kedr_coi.html#interceptor_creation.object_geometry.indirect">Section 3.2.1.2, “Indirect interceptor”</a>) may be used as binded, attempt to use direct interceptor for this purpose will lead to error.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="foreign_interceptor_creation.object_geometry"></a>3.3.2. Object's geometry</h4></div></div></div><p>
The only parameter described object's geometry is an offset of the pointer to operations structure inside the prototype object.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="foreign_interceptor_creation.intermediate_operations"></a>3.3.3. Intermediate operations</h4></div></div></div><p>
Like a normal interceptor, foreign one uses <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#intermediate_operation"><em class="firstterm">intermediate operations</em></a> for implement interception mechanism. And like for a normal interceptor, intermediate operations for foreign one should be implemented by hands.
</p><p>
For foreign interceptor, intermediate operations should be only defined for those operations in prototype which will be called just after object is created from this prototype. E.g., the first operation which is called for file object when it is created is <code class="function">open</code>. So only this operation requires intermediate one.
</p><p>
Intermediate operation for foreign interceptor should have same signature as operation it replace, and implements following simple logic:
</p><div class="procedure"><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step"><p>
Locally allocate(on stack) pointer to the original operation.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
Call <code class="function">kedr_coi_bind_prototype_with_object</code> and pass to it foriegn interceptor, prototype object, newly created object, offset of the operation replaced by this intermediate one and reference to the allocated pointer to the original operation.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
Call original callback operation. If pointer to it is <code class="constant">NULL</code>, <a class="firstterm" href="glossary.html#default_callback_operation"><em class="firstterm">default callback operation</em></a> should be called.
</p></li><li class="step"><p>
If original operation returns any value, return this value.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
For example, intermediate operation for foreign interceptor, used character device('struct cdev') as prototype object for create file object('<span class="type">struct file</span>') may be implemented as follow:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
struct kedr_coi_foreign_interceptor* foreign_interceptor;
//...
static int intermediate_open(struct inode* inode, struct file* filp)
{
    int (*op_chained)(struct inode * inode, struct file * filp);

    kedr_coi_bind_prototype_with_object(foreign_interceptor,
        inode-&gt;i_cdev,
        filp,
        offsetof(struct file_operations, open),
        (void**)&amp;op_chained);
    
    return op_chained? op_chained(inode, filp) : 0;
}
</pre><p>
Note, that like for a normal interceptor, intermediate operation for foreing interceptor should correctly process case when original callback operation is <code class="constant">NULL</code>. For <code class="function">open</code> operation <code class="constant">NULL</code> pointer equivalents to callback simply returning <code class="constant">0</code>.
