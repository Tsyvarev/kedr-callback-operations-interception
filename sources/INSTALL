Installation instructions.

For configuring package, CMake utility should be used(available at http://cmake.org/).

Standard steps for configuring, building and installing package:

cd <build-dir>
cmake <source-dir>
make
make install

Here <source-dir> is a directory with source files, <build-dir> is a
directory for build KEDR COI package.
Any directory may be used for build package, but it is better to not
use <source-dir> for that purpose.

See doc/html/install.html for more information about configuring,
building and installing KEDR COI.
